** Lecture Information

*WARNING:* This is the content only covered by me as this lecture is shared by
both me and Prof. Bernhard Hollaus, Ph.D.

The goal of this lecture is to introduce to you the interesting world of machine
control with the use of experimental methods. The student will apply control
methods to motor by using embedded devices and analyse experimental results with
simulations.

The structure for this lecture is as follows.
